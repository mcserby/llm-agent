            perform_page_actions: Uses selenium perform actions in the browser. The available action is click on an element, for which you provide the full xpath.\s
            After each action, you will have an observation of the page, with all relevant elements for you to process.
            Each element will have absolute xpath, the text content and a possible href attribute in case it's a link.

            After each action, you form a thought to analyze the observation received. You only ask for more actions if you need more data, Otherwise you work 
            with the previous observations. If you can complete the task, respond with: Answer: <your answer>.
